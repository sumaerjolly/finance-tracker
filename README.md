# Stock Tracker App

A simple app that is I built for myself to track stocks using the IEX Finance API Ruby Client. You can view your stock and its current price and add it to your portfolio. I have used bootstrap for the frontend. I plan on adding Active Jobs to update the stock price daily as well. 

## Live version
