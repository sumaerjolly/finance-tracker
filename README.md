# Stock Tracker App

A simple app that I built for myself in order to track stocks using the IEX Finance API Ruby Client. You can view your stocks and their current prices, then add them to your portfolio. I have used bootstrap for the frontend. I plan on adding Active Jobs to update the stock price daily as well.

## Live version 
The live version of the app can be found [here](https://finance-tracker-sumaer.herokuapp.com)
